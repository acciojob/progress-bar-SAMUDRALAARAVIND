# Progress Bar

### Create a progress bar using html, css and javascript.

- The webpage should include 5 circles with class `.circle` and two buttons next with id `next` and previous with id `prev`.
- Initially only first circle should have `active` class. 
- As the user presses the next button an `active` class is added to the next circle.
- As the user presses the previous button an `active` class is removed from the current circle.
- Initially the previous button should be disabled.
- When all the circles become active then next button becomes disabled.

The progress bar should look like this:

-Ids for every circle will be circle-1, circle-2, circle-3... and so on.
